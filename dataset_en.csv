Who won the last World Cup?,The 2022 World Cup was held in Qatar, where Argentina emerged as the winner. It was an exciting match full of twists, as Argentina was leading 2-0 against France until the French player Kylian Mbappe equalized the game in just 2 minutes. However, Argentina didn't give up, and after a penalty caused by the French right-winger Ousmane Dembele, Lionel Messi scored the 3-2 in favor of Argentina in the 107th minute. But Kylian Mbappe scored from a penalty in the 117th minute, completing a hat-trick and equalizing the score again.
