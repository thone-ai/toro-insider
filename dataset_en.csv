Mercury's surface is covered with craters, mountains, and plains, the result of violent collisions between asteroids and comets throughout its history. NASA's MESSENGER probe provided important information about its surface and composition.
What is Venus?,Venus is the closest planet to the Sun and is often called "Earth's twin" due to its similar size and mass. But despite the similarities, Venus is a hostile world. It is enveloped by a thick atmosphere mainly composed of carbon dioxide and sulfuric acid clouds, leading to a strong greenhouse effect and scorching surface temperatures of up to 475°C (887°F), hotter than Mercury despite being farther from the Sun. The pressure on Venus is approximately 92 times that of Earth, equivalent to the pressure below water at over 900 meters deep. Additionally, Venus has a slow retrograde rotation, meaning its day lasts more than a year.
What is Jupiter?,Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest planet. It is a gas giant composed mainly of hydrogen and helium and lacks a well-defined solid surface. Jupiter is known for its magnificent ring system and many moons. Its famous Great Red Spot is a giant storm that has been active for centuries. Jupiter's strong gravity attracted a large number of moons, the four largest of which are known as the "Galilean moons": Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. These moons are fascinating bodies, and some scientists believe Europa may have a subsurface ocean, sparking interest in future missions to search for signs of life.
What is Saturn?,Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and is known for its stunning rings, primarily composed of ice and rock particles. Like Jupiter, Saturn is a gas giant with an atmosphere mostly composed of hydrogen and helium. Its rings are one of the most unique and beautiful features in the Solar System, consisting of trillions of tiny particles orbiting the planet. Saturn also has a large collection of moons, some of which are quite large, such as Titan, which has a dense atmosphere and liquid methane rain on its surface, making it a unique place for study.
What is Uranus?,Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and an ice giant composed mainly of hydrogen, helium, and methane. Unlike the previous gas giants, Uranus has an unusual tilt in that its axis of rotation is almost in the plane of its orbit, causing it to "roll" sideways instead of spinning upright. This results in extremely long seasons of about 21 Earth years each. Uranus also has rings, although much less spectacular than Saturn's, and a diverse system of moons.
What is Neptune?,Neptune is the eighth and last recognized planet in the solar system. It is another gas giant, primarily composed of hydrogen, helium, and methane, which gives it its intense blue color. Neptune is famous for its strong winds and the Great Dark Spot, a storm system similar to Jupiter's Great Red Spot. It also has a ring system, although these are difficult to detect from Earth. Prominent among its moons is Triton, the only known object in the Solar System with a retrograde orbit (opposite to Neptune's rotation), suggesting it may have been captured rather than forming alongside the planet.
