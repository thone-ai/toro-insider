What is Venus?,Venus is the closest planet to the Sun and is often called "Earth's twin" due to its similar size and mass. But despite the similarities, Venus is a hostile world. It is enveloped by a thick atmosphere mainly composed of carbon dioxide and sulfuric acid clouds, leading to a strong greenhouse effect and scorching surface temperatures of up to 475°C (887°F), hotter than Mercury despite being farther from the Sun.

Saturn also has a large collection of moons, some of which are quite large, such as Titan, which has a dense atmosphere and liquid methane rain on its surface, making it a unique place for study.
What is Uranus?,Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun and an ice giant composed mainly of hydrogen, helium, and methane. Unlike the previous gas giants, Uranus has an unusual tilt in that its axis of rotation is almost in the plane of its orbit, causing it to "roll" sideways instead of spinning upright. This results in extremely long seasons of about 21 Earth years each. Uranus also has rings, although much less spectacular than Saturn's, and a diverse system of moons.
What is Neptune?,Neptune is the eighth and last recognized planet in the solar system. It is another gas giant, primarily composed of hydrogen, helium, and methane, which gives it its intense blue color.

Prominent among its moons is Triton, the only known object in the Solar System with a retrograde orbit (opposite to Neptune's rotation), suggesting it may have been captured rather than forming alongside the planet.
